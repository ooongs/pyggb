### ⚠️ Type Mismatch Error

You provided the wrong type of input to a command.

**Common type errors:**

1. **Circle needs center point, not coordinates**
```
# WRONG:
circle : 100 100 50 -> c  # Can't use raw coordinates!
# CORRECT:
point : 100 100 -> O
circle : O 50 -> c
```

2. **Line needs two points**
```
# WRONG:
line : A -> line_A  # Need two points!
# CORRECT:
line : A B -> line_AB
```

3. **Rotate needs point, angle, center**
```
# WRONG:
rotate : A B -> C  # Missing angle!
# CORRECT:
rotate : A 60 B -> C  # Rotate A by 60° around B
```

4. **Intersect needs geometric objects**
```
# WRONG:
intersect : A B -> P  # A, B are points!
# CORRECT:
intersect : line1 line2 -> P  # Use lines/circles
```

**Tip**: Check what type of input each command expects.
