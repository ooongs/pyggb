### ⚠️ Undefined Object Error

You tried to use an object that hasn't been defined yet.

**Rule**: Define objects BEFORE using them!

**Example - WRONG:**
```
line : A B -> line_AB  # Error: A and B not defined yet!
```

**Example - CORRECT:**
```
point :  -> A          # Define A first
point :  -> B          # Define B second
line : A B -> line_AB  # Now you can use A and B
```

**Common mistakes:**
- Using a point before defining it with `point :  -> X`
- Using a circle/line before creating it
- Typo in object name (case-sensitive!)
