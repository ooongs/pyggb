### ⚠️ Geometric Construction Error

Your DSL code attempted to create an impossible or invalid geometric object.

**Common geometric impossibilities:**

1. **Identical Points Creating Segment/Line**
```dsl
# WRONG - P and Q are the same point
point : 50 50 -> P
point : 50 50 -> Q
segment : P Q -> seg  # Error: cannot create segment from identical points
```
**Fix**: Ensure points are distinct
```dsl
# CORRECT
point : 50 50 -> P
point : 100 50 -> Q
segment : P Q -> seg  # Works: P ≠ Q
```

**Common cause**: Circle-line intersection where line passes through circle center
```dsl
# Example from your error:
circle : O A -> circle_OA
line : C O -> line_CO  # Line passes through circle center O
intersect : line_CO circle_OA -> P  # P = O (line through center intersects at center)
segment : P O -> PO  # Error: P and O are the same point!
```

2. **Parallel Lines Intersection**
```dsl
# WRONG - lines are parallel
line : A B -> line1
parallel_line : C line1 -> line2
intersect : line1 line2 -> P  # Error: parallel lines don't intersect
```
**Fix**: Use non-parallel lines or check geometry first
```dsl
# CORRECT - use different construction
line : A B -> line1
line : C D -> line2  # Not parallel
intersect : line1 line2 -> P  # Works if lines aren't parallel
```

3. **Zero or Negative Radius Circle**
```dsl
# WRONG
circle : O 0 -> c  # Error: radius must be positive
circle : O -5 -> c  # Error: radius must be positive
```
**Fix**: Use positive radius
```dsl
# CORRECT
circle : O 50 -> c  # Works
```

4. **Polar Line of Circle Center**
```dsl
# WRONG - P is at circle center
circle : O 50 -> circle_O
polar : O circle_O -> line  # Error: polar of center is undefined
```
**Fix**: Use a point not at the center
```dsl
# CORRECT
point : 100 0 -> P  # Point not at center
polar : P circle_O -> line  # Works
```

5. **Intersection Outside Ray/Segment Bounds**
```dsl
# Ray/segment intersection may not exist within bounds
line : A B -> line1
segment : C D -> seg1
intersect : line1 seg1 -> P  # May fail if intersection is outside segment CD
```
**Fix**: Use full lines instead, or ensure intersection is within bounds
```dsl
# Option 1: Use full lines
line : A B -> line1
line : C D -> line2
intersect : line1 line2 -> P  # Works: infinite lines always intersect (if not parallel)

# Option 2: Check construction ensures intersection is within bounds
```

**Debugging Tips:**

1. **Check point coordinates**: Print or verify that points you think are different actually have different coordinates
2. **Visualize construction**: Use the preview to see where points actually end up
3. **Break down complex constructions**: If an intersection creates a point that causes problems, check what that intersection actually produces
4. **Use angle/distance checks**: Before creating geometric objects, verify constraints are satisfied

**General Rule**: Verify your geometric construction is mathematically valid before attempting to create derived objects!
