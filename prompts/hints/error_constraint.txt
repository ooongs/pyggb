### ⚠️ Invalid Constraint Error

DSL is for CONSTRUCTING geometry, not for asserting constraints!

**What you CANNOT do:**
```
# WRONG - These don't work!
equality : angle_ABC 80 -> expr  # Can't assert angle value
parallel : line1 line2 -> expr   # Can't assert parallel
perpendicular : l1 l2 -> expr    # Can't assert perpendicular
```

**How to achieve constraints through construction:**

1. **Specific angle value → Use rotation**
```
point : 0 0 -> A
point : 100 0 -> B
rotate : B 80 A -> C  # Angle CAB = 80°
```

2. **Parallel lines → Use parallel_line command**
```
line : A B -> line_AB
parallel_line : C line_AB -> line_CD  # CD ∥ AB
```

3. **Perpendicular lines → Use orthogonal_line command**
```
line : A B -> line_AB
orthogonal_line : C line_AB -> perp  # perp ⊥ AB
```

**Tip**: Construct geometry to naturally have the desired properties!
