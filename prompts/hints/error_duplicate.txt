### ⚠️ Duplicate Label Error

You tried to define the same label twice.

**Rule**: Each label can only be defined ONCE!

**Example - WRONG:**
```
point :  -> A
point : 100 100 -> A  # Error: A already exists!
```

**Example - CORRECT:**
```
point :  -> A
point : 100 100 -> B  # Use different label
```

**If you need to "update" a point:**
- You cannot! DSL doesn't support reassignment
- Use a different label name instead
- Plan your construction order carefully

**Tip**: Use descriptive names to avoid conflicts:
- `A`, `B`, `C` for main points
- `M_AB` for midpoint of AB
- `P1`, `P2` for auxiliary points
